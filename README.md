# react-snake-game
A implementation of the classic Snake game using React+Canvas

# An example only

This is a weekend project that I threw together. It was built within a webpack system, but does not specifically bring in webpack or package.json. In fact you won't be able to build or run this game by itself, you'd have to put it within a webpack-like system in order to run it. Instead this should serve as an example of how you can use React to manage state, and compose components even within a non-DOM rendering context like Canvas.
