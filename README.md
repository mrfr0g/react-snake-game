# react-snake-game
A implementation of the classic Snake game using React+Canvas

# An example only

This is a weekend project that I threw together. It should serve as an example of how you can use React to manage state, and compose components even within a non-DOM rendering context like Canvas.

# Building

This was built with webpack, I highly recommend taking a look at browniefed's starter kit, https://github.com/browniefed/react-webpack-empty-starter

## Install dependencies

This does require webpack to be installed with the global flag, so you may have to sudo npm install

    npm install

Run the webpack server

    npm run server

Start the express server, port 9000

    npm run start

## Play

After following the instructions above you should be able to access the game at http://localhost:9000
